# claude-code-hooks

A portable set of hooks for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) that add observability, context persistence, file protection, intelligent agent routing, bash command intelligence recording, syntax validation, git awareness, and session analytics.

## What's Included

| Hook | Event | What It Does |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Desktop Notifications** | Notification | Native OS alert when Claude needs your attention |
| **Protected Files** | PreToolUse (Edit\|Write) | Blocks edits to `.env`, credentials, keys, lock files; scans content for secrets |
| **Observability Logger** | All event types | Appends every hook event to a structured JSONL log with enriched metadata |
| **Syntax Validator** | PostToolUse (Write\|Edit\|MultiEdit) | Catches Python, JSON, and TOML syntax errors immediately after writes |
| **Bash Command Recorder** | PostToolUse (Bash) | Records executed commands for the intelligence graph |
| **Session Stats** | Stop | Prints per-session summary; writes structured stats; rotates large log files |
| **Git Context** | SessionStart | Injects current branch, status, and recent commits into Claude's context |
| **File Cleanup** | SessionStart | Prunes old handoff and session files on a configurable retention schedule |
| **Handoff System** | PreCompact + SessionStart | Saves session state before compaction, restores it after |
| **Session Summaries** | PreCompact | Writes a summary of each session segment to disk |
| **Pending Learnings** | PreCompact + SessionStart | Extracts learnings and surfaces them for review |
| **Agent Team Suggestions** | UserPromptSubmit | Recommends parallel agents for complex tasks |
| **Auto-approve ExitPlanMode** | PermissionRequest | Skips the permission dialog for plan mode exit |

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) (CLI or Desktop)
- Python 3.8+
- **Windows:** Git Bash (to run `install.sh`) — all hook scripts are Python and work natively

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dwsmarketing/claude-code-hooks.git
cd claude-code-hooks
bash install.sh
```

**Windows:** Open Git Bash, then run the commands above. All hook scripts are Python 3 and work cross-platform without Git Bash after installation.

The installer:
1. Detects your Python command (`python3` or `python`)
2. Detects your OS for native notifications (macOS, Windows, Linux)
3. Copies hook scripts to `~/.claude/hooks/`
4. Creates required directories (`logs/`, `handoffs/`, `docs/sessions/`)
5. Merges the hooks configuration into your existing `~/.claude/settings.json`

Hooks take effect on your next Claude Code session.

> **Existing settings.json?** The installer replaces only the `hooks` key. All other settings are preserved. Back up your settings file before running if you have custom hooks you want to keep.

## How It Works

### Observability

Every hook event is logged to `~/.claude/logs/hook-events.jsonl` as one JSON line with enriched metadata:

```json
{"timestamp":"2026-04-03T14:22:01.003Z","event":"PostToolUse","session_id":"abc123","tool_name":"Bash","tool_command":"npm run build","data":{...}}
```

Query with standard tools:
```bash
# Count events by type
python3 -c "
import json
from collections import Counter
with open('$HOME/.claude/logs/hook-events.jsonl') as f:
    c = Counter(json.loads(l)['event'] for l in f)
print(dict(c))
"

# Last 10 events
tail -10 ~/.claude/logs/hook-events.jsonl | python3 -m json.tool
```

At session end, `session-stats.py` prints a one-line summary and writes to `~/.claude/logs/session-summaries.jsonl`. Log files are auto-rotated when they exceed 5 MB.

### Syntax Validation

After every file write or edit, `validate-syntax.py` checks the file for syntax errors:

- **`.py`** — validated with Python's built-in `py_compile`
- **`.json`** — validated with `json.load`
- **`.toml`** — validated with `tomllib` (Python 3.11+) or `tomli` if installed

Syntax errors are fed back to Claude immediately so they can be fixed in the same turn.

### Git Context

At every session start, `git-context.py` injects:
- Current branch name and repo name
- Uncommitted file count (if any)
- Last 3 commit messages

Output is only shown when inside a git repository. Exits silently otherwise.

### Bash Command Intelligence

The `record-bash.py` hook fires after every `Bash` tool use and writes the executed command to `.claude-flow/data/pending-insights.jsonl` in your project directory. This integrates with the [claude-flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow) intelligence graph:

- Commands run **3 or more times** in a session are promoted to graph nodes at session end
- The intelligence system surfaces frequently-used commands as context on relevant future prompts
- Works independently of claude-flow — the JSONL file is a plain text append log if claude-flow is not installed

Data written per command:
```json
{"type": "command", "file": "npm run build", "timestamp": 1712345678901, "cwd": "/path/to/project"}
```

### Context Persistence (Handoff System)

When Claude Code compacts your conversation, the **PreCompact** agent hook automatically:

1. Writes a **handoff file** (`~/.claude/handoffs/handoff-{timestamp}.md`) with: current goal, work completed, decisions made, open tasks, key context
2. Writes a **session summary** (`~/.claude/docs/sessions/{timestamp}.md`) with: what was accomplished, files changed, errors encountered
3. Appends **pending learnings** to `~/.claude/docs/pending-learnings.md`

On the next session start (or after compaction), the **SessionStart** hooks:
- Load the latest handoff into Claude's context
- Surface any pending learnings for review

Old handoffs are pruned after 7 days; session summaries after 30 days (configurable via env vars — see `cleanup.py`).

### File Protection

Blocks Claude from editing sensitive files (path-based):
- `.env`, `.gitignore`
- `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`
- Private keys (`.key`, `.pem`, `.cert`, `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`)
- Files matching `secrets` or `credentials`

Also scans the **content** being written for credential patterns including cloud provider keys, VCS tokens, API key assignments, and private key headers. Security events are logged to `~/.claude/logs/security-events.jsonl`.

When blocked, Claude receives feedback explaining why and is asked to get explicit user permission.

### Agent Team Suggestions

The `suggest-agents.py` hook analyzes each user prompt for complexity signals:

| Signal | Points | Examples |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Scope keywords | 2 | "implement feature", "debug complex", "full-stack" |
| Broad scope | 1 | "all files", "entire codebase", "multiple components" |
| Multi-step language | 1–2 | numbered lists, "first...then", "after that" |
| Compound problems | 1 | "not sure if X or Y", "middleware...database" |
| Direct request | auto | "use parallel agents", "agent teams" |

At 3+ points, it suggests specific approaches:
- **Debug tasks** — parallel hypothesis testing
- **Review tasks** — multi-dimensional review
- **Feature tasks** — parallel development
- **Refactor tasks** — parallel subagents with file ownership

Simple prompts produce no output.

## Platform Compatibility

All hook scripts in this repo are Python 3. The `.sh` files are included as reference and for users who prefer bash on macOS/Linux, but `settings-hooks.json` references only the Python equivalents.

## Customization

### Add protected file patterns

Edit `~/.claude/hooks/protect-files.py` and add patterns to the `PROTECTED_PATH_PATTERNS` list.

### Adjust file retention periods

Set environment variables before the session, or configure them in your shell profile:
```bash
export CLAUDE_HANDOFF_RETENTION_DAYS=14   # default: 7
export CLAUDE_SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS=60   # default: 30
```

### Adjust agent suggestion sensitivity

Edit `~/.claude/hooks/suggest-agents.py`:
- Change the threshold (default: 3 points) on the line with `if score < 3`
- Add keyword patterns to the regex constants at the top

### Disable specific hooks

Remove or comment out entries in the `hooks` section of `~/.claude/settings.json`.

## Uninstall

```bash
# Remove hook scripts
rm ~/.claude/hooks/{protect-files.py,protect-files.sh,log-event.py,load-handoff.py,load-handoff.sh,load-learnings.py,load-learnings.sh,suggest-agents.py,record-bash.py,validate-syntax.py,session-stats.py,git-context.py,cleanup.py}

# Remove the hooks key from settings.json
python3 -c "
import json, os
path = os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/settings.json')
with open(path) as f: d = json.load(f)
d.pop('hooks', None)
with open(path, 'w') as f: json.dump(d, f, indent=2)
"
```

Data directories (`logs/`, `handoffs/`, `docs/`) are preserved. Delete manually if not needed.
